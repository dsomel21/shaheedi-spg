When Maharaj reaches Nirmogarh they notice Bhai Ajit Singh Ji is not with them. Maharaj looks to the back of the Jatha to see Baba Ajit Singh fighting with hundreds of Mughals. On reaching Sarsa river, Maharaj sends Baba Uday Singh Ji to go and fight with mughals and to bring back Baba Ajit Singh Ji. Baba Uday Singh Ji received a boon that when you attain Shaheedi in the Battlefield, and go to Sachkhand, you will sit on right hand side of me there. Wherever you live, I will live there as well"
